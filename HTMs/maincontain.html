        <p>This is an essential yeoman’s service that is a continuous project for us. Currently holding over 150 texts, the Open Library is a repository of readings, books, papers, scriptures and more covering Indian knowledge systems and all things dharma. We have here works like Sri Aurobindo’s Secret of the Veda, and Motilal Banarsidass’ complete collection of the Maha Puranas. At a special section- The Aryan Issue- we collect all relevant academic material on the matter of Aryan invasion/migration. The Open Library is currently preparing a search-able compendium of all Vedas and Puranas. </p>

        <p>We live in a world of design- from hospital or airport layouts, the screens we interact with all day, or even the policies that affect our lives. And what is culture, if not the deliberate and well-crafted collective design of a people? A Sanskriti? In our mission to further dharma, we must have a blueprint for introducing dharma into design thinking and design in general. Ṛta in Design is our project to serve this cause. In July 2022 we launched the initial document- An Introduction to Ṛta in Design. And in December 2022 are preparing the complete guide- The Ṛta in Design System for Design Thinking.

        <p>Is Bṛhat's blog for essays and short reads covering culture, policy and leadership. We believe that  by drawing from the deep pool of dharma for creative storytelling, enabling the roadmap for culture-compatible policy and seeding the cognition required to bear culture forward, we can create the self-perpetuating civilizational moment.

Through this, we also seek to impart the ways of looking and seeing, darśana, so that the learners can also proceed on the path of being draṣṭās. 2 courses were offered under the firekeepers of civilization, on 2 great stalwarts of the Hindu renaissance - Shri Ram Swarup and Shri Sita Ram Goel</p>

        <p> Is a guided travel program in tribute to some of the most important cultural assemblages in India including its temples, civilizational centers and living systems. It seeks to contemporize the entire tradition of travelling to sacred kṣetras, where both the inner and the outer quest of man for discovery is quenched in a way that is not just fulfilling, fun and satisfying but also spiritually and culturally elevating

        <p>We realize that history is to a civilization as memory is to a consciousness. The reclamation of Bhāratīya history is therefore of critical importance. To this end, our project Fractal Maṇḍala studies Indian civilizational emergence and traces true history. Here we establish the base paradigm to recalibrate thinking towards, a decolonized one, and will embark on true narratives for the stuff of historia- chronology, invasions/migrations, Pauranic timelines, etc.
